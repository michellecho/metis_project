Metis Intro to Data Science Course Project

**Project Description:**

1. What is the question you hope to answer?
> **Natural Language Processing & Sentiment Analysis**

> attributes, and sentiment.

Goal: to predict positive or negative Yelp reviews using [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html).
